I feel so comfortable driving - although I do not do alot of mileage,mainly short distances, fuel consumption is already at 40mpg. I am a ford customer for over 50 years and it is the best car I have ever had. Keep up the good work.",

The radio control on the steering wheel is in the most ridiculous place. It was perfect on the previous model 06 but is now rather dangerous to use when driving as the driver does not have full control of the wheel.Drives beautifully though.",

The 1.6 EcoBoost 150 is a good engine. \nBut some comparatively minor things haven't been thought through - \nSat Nav - the option to show the current road speed limit is removed  when the traffic sign recognition pack is installed and the arrival time is covered when the direction arrows are shown.\nThe traffic sign recognition system doesn't display the signs for long enough - a national speed limit sign  is on the screen for less than 10 seconds.",
